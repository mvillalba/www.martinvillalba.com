Introduction
==========
These are the sources of my main personal website.  It gets turned into an
actual website with the help of [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde "Hyde").

You can reach me at: ehyde at codinghyde com


Setup
=====
The buildout environment should be entirely self-contained,
web server included.

If you want to modify the website, clone the repository and run:
% source bootstrap && buildout

If you want to publish the website, push upstream (odin). Once uploaded, a
server-side hook will run and do the following (publish.py):
 1) Clone repository to temp directory.
 2) Are buildout.cfg or nginx.conf any different from those used by the
    currently running webserver instance?
 3) If so, stop web-server, pull repository, and run buildout.
 4) Else, just pull repository.
 5) Run hyde.
 6) Start web-server if not currently running.
