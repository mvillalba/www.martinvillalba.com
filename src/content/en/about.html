Me
---
My name is Martín Raúl Villalba, I'm currently 20, and I'm a self-taught
software developer, language learner, runner, mountaineer (dare I say), health
freak (or so they say), and a bunch more things.  And before you ask, yes, I'm
kind of a geek.

I like simple, logical, and efficient things (like this website, for the most
part).  I strive to make my life simple, fun, and well-balanced. But ironically
enough, many a time this is quite a complex thing to achieve.


This Website
------------
This website is edited with [VIM](http://www.vim.org/about.php) under
[Debian](http://www.debian.org), source-controlled with
[git](http://git-scm.com/), turned into an actual website with the help of the
fantastic static website generator [Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/),
and hosted on [Google App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/).

This source code for this website is [open source](https://github.com/mvillalba/www.martinvillalba.com).

And yes, this website is currently lacking in many ways.  That's because it's
new, and I have little time to edit it. But fear not, I'll be adding something
to it every week, so come back next week!
