Projects
========
The following is a list of my public projects, mostly open source in nature.

codinghyde.ant
--------------
Python implementation of the ANT, ANT+, and ANT-FS protocols
 (http://www.thisisant.com/).

**Rationale**: I needed a way to extract information from my Garmin Forerunner
 310XT and related accesories for data analysis and Garmin does not support
 *nix platforms.

**Website**: [http://www.codinghyde.org/projects/ant/](http://www.codinghyde.org/projects/ant/)

**Repository**: [https://github.com/codinghyde/codinghyde.ant](https://github.com/codinghyde/codinghyde.ant)


codinghyde.griffin
------------------
Workout data analysis (aimed at runners) program for GNU/Linux and other *nix
 operating systems.

**Rationale**: Extending on codinghyde.ant, I didn't want to depend on my Windows
 virtual machine to analyze my workout data, nor could I find a workout analysis
 program for runners that would run on GNU/Linux and would allow me to easily
 and painlessly script it to generate the very specific statistics I'm interested
 in.

codinghyde.namecheap
--------------------
Python wrapper for Namecheap's APIs.

**Rationale**: Sometimes I need to buy domain names or update my Namecheap DynDNS
 settings programmatically.

www.martinvillalba.com
----------------------
My personal website.

**Rationale**: I wanted a place I could call my "online home", somewhere to dump
 all my public ideas to, list my projects, upload some pictures, and post some
 articles to.
