Projects
========
The following is an incomplete list of my public projects, mostly open source
in nature.


python-ant
----------
Python implementation of the ANT, ANT+, and ANT-FS protocols
 (http://www.thisisant.com/).

**Rationale**: I needed a way to extract information from my Garmin Forerunner
 310XT and related accesories for data analysis and Garmin does not support
 *nix platforms.

python-namecheap
----------------
Python wrapper for Namecheap's APIs.

**Rationale**: Sometimes I need to buy domain names or update my Namecheap
DynDNS settings programmatically, or would rather do it faster than the Web
interface allows me to (CLI).

www.martinvillalba.com
----------------------
My personal website.

**Rationale**: I wanted a place I could call my "online home", somewhere to dump
all my public ideas to, list my projects, upload some pictures, and post some
articles to.  A website I can give to my friends, family, peers, and even
potential business partners.
