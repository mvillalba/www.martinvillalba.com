Thins to consider
=================
 * Portfolio/CV section.
 * Useful links section.
 * Job offers/proposals/wanted section.
 * Detailed projects page (not just a link to codinghyde.com/org).
 * "What I'm up to right now" section (active projects, articles, etc).
   Perhaps this could be a sub-section in the index?
 * Social links (LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Forrst, etc).
 * "Current Missions" section (things like "Run a Marathon" and "Learn JP".
   This could be a sub-section to the About section.
 * One blog to rule them all? Or one professional and one personal?
   Or just one blog and have each article tagged under a dominant section,
   and have a section-only article index. Sections could be "Language and
   travelling", "Software development", "Health and fitness", "Community
   projects".
 * "Past adventures" section (travelling, languages, businesses, etc).
 * Organize the site so that someone interested in my programming stuff
   doesn't have to digg through cooking recipes and vice versa.
 * Photo albums.
 * "Reading list" section (what I'm reading, what I've read, and a general
   review of each book). This could also be a blog section.
 * "List of valid handles" section (list of the only places where I can be
   found on the web (with usernames) to avoid impersonation by a third party.
   If it's not on the list, it's not me...
 * Implement some ideas from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1316100/what-contents-should-a-professional-programmers-website-have.
 * GPG Keys section (fingerprints, public keys).
 * Move language metadata from site.yaml to content/LANG/meta.yaml.
 * Customize blueprint project.
