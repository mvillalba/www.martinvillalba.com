Notes

Things to consider
-----------------
 * Portfolio/CV section.
 * Useful links section.
 * Job offers/proposals/wanted section.
 * Detailed projects page (not just a link to codinghyde.com/org).
 * "What I'm up to right now" section (active projects, articles, etc).
   Perhaps this could be a sub-section in the index?
 * Social links (LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Forrst, etc).
 * "Current Missions" section (things like "Run a Marathon" and "Learn JP".
   This could be a sub-section to the About section.
 * One blog to rule them all? Or one professional and one personal?
   Or just one blog and have each article tagged under a dominant section,
   and have a section-only article index. Sections could be "Language and
   travelling", "Software development", "Health and fitness", "Community
   projects".
 * "Past adventures" section (travelling, languages, businesses, etc).
 * Organize the site so that someone interested in my programming stuff
   doesn't have to digg through cooking recipes and vice versa.
 * Photo albums.
 * "Reading list" section (what I'm reading, what I've read, and a general
   review of each book). This could also be a blog section.
 * "List of valid handles" section (list of the only places where I can be
   found on the web (with usernames) to avoid impersonation by a third party.
   If it's not on the list, it's not me...
 * Implement some ideas from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1316100/what-contents-should-a-professional-programmers-website-have.
 * GPG Keys section (fingerprints, public keys).
 * Move language metadata from site.yaml to content/LANG/meta.yaml.
 * Customize blueprint project.
 * Need a sitemap.
 * Missions == tagged blog posts?
 * Website should be a dumping ground and public log of information for my own
   reference, mostly. This may include a file download section (private).
 * Put a photo of myself (about page). Use something like a summit picture.
 * Things I [don't] believe in (religion, politics, software, etc).
 * Other "Mart√≠n Villalba"s section. Only list those who contact me.
 * Cooking recipes should have pictures and maybe a demonstration video (hosted
   in youtube, of course, made by me, with remakes in different languages). This
   may be overkill for the simplest ones though.
 * On cooking, also post little techniques and tips, like how to crack an egg
   with your knuckles, or something.
 * How about Hyde plugins to calculate my current age, generate my affiliate
   and Web accounts pages, redirect (JS) based on language, and similar stuff.
 * "Photos" menu item, with integration to public Picasa albums.
 * Add last-edited timestamp at the bottom of every page (taken from YAML meta
   data on each page).


App Engine
----------
May need to work around limitations described in the following link at some
point:
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/runtime.html#Quotas_and_Limits
I may also need a small note in the README.md file to tell me what I need to
change in order to add an article, a random (multi-lingual) page, a full new
language, etc.

Bugs
----
Non-ASCII file names cause weird encoding errors everywhere. Unicode handling
in Hyde or Jinja2 is horribly broken. Added rewrite-based hack for the time
 being. Should submit a patch.
